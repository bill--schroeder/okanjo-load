All this is going on safely and color controlled. There are also 2 to 3 outfielders, a pitcher (who does not p","itch), a catcher and a batter. There are 2 forms of competition: Team against team or player against player. There are 2 basic playing concepts. Baseball or cricket batters toss the ball up to hit, run with bat in hand (dropped bats must always be picked ","up) to the other side of the court, then back again to the start position. It's a race against the ball! While the batters are running, all players in the field must touch the ball by throwing it to one another. The final series of throws is from the pitc","her to the catcher. Upon receiving the ball, the catcher must place the ball atop the catcher s cone. If the batter makes it past the cone before the ball is placed on top of it, a run is scored. If the catcher places the ball on top of the cone before th","e runnerreturns, the runner is out. In each case (score or out), players rotate and a new batter is up. The game continues for a preset number of at-bats. American Version: Requires 12 cones; 2 per team. Each cone is placed on the court sidelines. After h","itting the ball, the batter must circle the far-side cone and return past the catcher s cone. Cricket Version: Requires 6 cones; 1 per team.

One side of each disk challenges students to identify a particular state",", based upon its outline, 2-letter postal abbreviation and capital s name and location (indicated with a Capital Star ). The other side of each disk presents a more difficult challenge by displaying the state s outline and capital star location only. To u","nderstand the difficulty of this challenge, you need only look at Colorado and Wyoming. Because their state outlines are virtually identical, trying to identify them by that feature alone would render the challenge to little more than a 50/50 guess. Howev","er, knowing Cheyenne is located in the lower right-hand-corner of the state, students can use the capital star's location to identify the state as Wyoming. You can add yet another layer of difficulty, with a GeoScramble . In a GeoScramble, states are posi","tioned randomly, either on a regional or universal basis. If you thought identifying the outline of Georgia was difficult, try recognizing it out of position. Every state the same size? While we do not want to redefine the rules of cartography, proportion","nal state sizing has always presented a problem in USA-map-based, physical movement programs. States like Maryland become nearly invisible under foot in an environment where it must be in the exact proportion to California.
